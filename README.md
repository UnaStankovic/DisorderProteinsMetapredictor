# DisorderProteinsMetapredictor
This project represents my Master Studies final project. 
The main idea is to create metapredictor which will use the method of consensus to determine the structure of a protein (disordered or not) for the following predictors:
1. SPINE-D/ SPOT-D  
2. PONDR  
3. DISEMBL  
4. IUPred  
    
In the paper, written in Serbian, you can find an explanation for all the methods and biology terms used during the development.
The software, itself, will be fully in Python with GUI in HTML-CSS-JS and in English. 
All the software used while creating this project is used for academic purposes only. 
The full list of literature used in gathering information can be found in the bottom of the .pdf file.
