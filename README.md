# DisorderProteinsMetapredictor
This project represents my Master Studies final project. 
The main idea is to create metapredictor which will use the method of consensus to determine the best out of following 7 predictors:
1. SPINE-D
2. PONDR
3. s2D
4. IUPred
5. ESpritz
6. SEG
7. Disopred2
In the paper, written in Serbian, you can find an explanation for all the methods and biology terms used during the development.
The software, itself, will be fully in English.
